Being a good parent is, of course, what every parent would like to be. But
defining what it means to be a good parent is undoubtedly very 1,
particularly since children respond differently to the same style of parenting. A calm, rule-following child might respond better to a different sort of parenting than, 2, a younger sibling.

3, there’s another sort of parent that’s a bit easier to 4: a patient
parent. Children of every age benefit from patient parenting. Still, 5 every parent would like to be patient, this is no easy 6. Sometimes parents get
exhausted and frustrated and are unable to maintain a 7 and composed
style with their kids. I understand this.

You’re only human, and sometimes your kids can 8 you just a little
too far. And then the 9 happens: You lose your patience and either scream
at your kids or say something that was a bit too 10 and does nobody any
good. You wish that you could 11 the clock and start over. We’ve all been
there.

12, even though it’s common, it’s important to keep in mind that in a
single moment of fatigue, you can say something to your child that you may
13 for a long time. This may not only do damage to your relationship with
your child but also 14 your child’s self-esteem.

If you consistently lose your 15 with your kids, then you are
inadvertently modeling a lack of emotional control for your kids. We are all
becoming increasingly aware of the 16 of modeling tolerance and patience
for the younger generation. This is a skill that will help them all throughout life.

In fact, the ability to emotionally regulate or maintain emotional control when 17 by stress is one of the most important of all life’s skills.

Certainly, it’s incredibly 18 to maintain patience at all times with
your children. A more practical goal is to try, to the best of your ability, to be as tolerant and composed as you can when faced with 19 situations involving
your children. I can promise you this: As a result of working toward this goal, you and your children will benefit and 20 from stressful moments feeling
better physically and emotionally.

Rats and other animals need to be highly at tuned to social signals from
others so that can identify friends to cooperate with and enemies to avoid. To find out if this extends to non-living beings, Loleh Quinn at the University of California, San Diego, and her colleagues tested whether rats can detect social signals form robotic rats.

They housed eight adult rats with two types of robotic rat- one social and
one asocial 一 for 5 our days. The robots rats were quite minimalist, resembling a chunkier version of a computer mouse with wheels-to move around and
colorful markings.

During the experiment, the social robot rat followed the living rats around,
played with the same toys, and opened caged doors to let trapped rats escape.

Meanwhile, the asocial robot simply moved forwards and backwards and side to
side
Next, the researchers trapped the robots in cages and gave the rats the
opportunity to release them by pressing a lever.

Across 18 trials each, the living rats were 52 percent more likely on
average to set the social robot free than the asocial one. This suggests that the rats perceived the social robot as a genuine social being. They may have bonded more with the social robot because it displayed behaviours like communal
exploring and playing. This could lead to the rats better remembering having
freed it earlier, and wanting the robot to return the favour when they get trapped, says Quinn.

The readiness of the rats to befriend the social robot was surprising given
its minimal design. The robot was the same size as a regular rat but resembled a simple plastic box on wheels.“We’ d assumed we’ d have to give it a moving
head and tail, facial features, and put a scene on it to make it smell like a real
rat, but that wasn’t necessary, ”says Janet Wiles at the University of Queensland in Australia, who helped with the research.

The finding shows how sensitive rats are to social cues, even when they
come from basic robots. Similarly, children tend to treat robots as if they are fellow beings, even when they display only simple social signals.“ We humans
seem to be fascinated by robots, and it turns out other animals are too,”says
Wiles.

Quin and her colleagues conducted a test to see if rats can__
[A] pickup social signals from non-living rats
[B] distinguish a friendly rat from a hostile one
[C] attain sociable traits through special training
[D] send out warning messages to their fellow

What did the social robot do during the experiment?

[A] It followed the social robot.

[B]It played with some toys.

[C] It set the trapped rats free.

[D]It moved around alone.

According to Quinn, the rats released the social robot because
they__
[A] tried to practice a means of escape
[B] expected it to do the same in return
[C] wanted to display their intelligence
[D]considered that an interesting game

James Wiles notes that rats__
[A]can remember other rat’s facial features
[B] differentiate smells better than sizes
[C] respond more to cations than to looks
[D]can be scared by a plastic box on wheels

It can be learned from the text that rats__
[A]appear to be adaptable to new surroundings
[B] are more socially active than other animals
C] behave differently from children in socializing
[D]are more sensitive to social cues than expected

It is true that CEO pay has gone up-top ones may make 300 times the pay
of typical workers on average, and since the mid-1970s CEO pay for large
publicly traded American corporations has, by varying estimates, gone up by
about 500% The typical CEO of a top American corporation now makes about
S18.9 million a year.

The best model for understanding the growth of CEO pay is that of limited
CEO talent in a world where business opportunities for the top firms are
growing rapidly. The efforts of America’s highest-earning 1% have been one of
the more dynamic elements of the global economy. It’s not popular to say, but
one reason their pay has gone up so much is that CEOs really have upped their
game relative to many other workers in the U.S. economy.

Today’s CEO, at least for major American firms, must have many mere
skills than simply being able to“run the company” CEOs must have a good
sense of financial markets and maybe even how the company should trade in
them. They also need better public relations skills than their predecessors, as the costs of even a minor slipup can be significant. Then there’ s the fact that large American companies are much more globalized than ever before,with
supply chains spread across a larger number of countries. To lead in that system requires knowledge that is farly mind-boggling plus, virtually all major
American companies are beyond this major CEOs still have to do all the
day-to-day work they have always done.

The common idea that high CEO pay is mainly about ripping people off
doesn’t explain history very well. By most measures, corporate governance has
become a lot tighter and more rigorous since the 1970s. Yet it is principally
during this period of stronger governance that CEO pay has been high and
rising. That suggests it is in the broader corporate interest to recruit top candidates for increasingly tough jobs.”
Furthermore, the highest CEO salaries are paid to outside candidates, not
to the cozy insider picks, another sign that high CEO pay is not some kind of
depredation at the expense of the rest of the company. And the stock market
reacts positively when companies tie CEO pay to, say, stock prices, a sign that those practices build up corporate value not just for the CEO.

Which of the following has contributed to CEO pay rise?

[A] The growth in the number of corporations
[B] The general pay rise with a better economy
[C] Increased business opportunities for top firms
[D] Close cooperation among leading economies

Compared with their predecessors, today’s CEOs are required to__
[A] foster a stronger sense of teamwork
[B] finance more research and development
[C] establish closer ties with tech companies
[D] operate more globalized companies

CEO pay has been rising since the 1970s despite__
[A] continual internal opposition
[B] strict corporate governance
[C] conservative business strategies
[D] Repeated government warnings

High CEO pay can be justified by the fact that it helps__
[A] confirm the status of CEOs
[B] motivate inside candidates
[C] boost the efficiency of CEOs
[D] increase corporate value

The most suitable title for this text would be__
[A] CEOs Are Not Overpaid
[B] CEO Pay: Past and Present
[C] CEOs’ challenges of Today
[D] CEO Traits: Not Easy to Define
Text 3
Madrid was hailed as a public health beacon last November when it rolled
out ambitious restrictions on the most polluting cars. Seven months and one
election day later, a new conservative city council suspended enforcement of
the clean air zone, a first step toward its possible demise.

Mayor Jose Luis Martinez -Almeida made opposition to the zone a
centrepiece of his election campaign, despite its success in improving air
quality. A judge has now overruled the city ‘s decision to stop levying fines, ordering them reinstated. But with legal battles ahead, the zone’s future looks uncertain at best.

Among other weaknesses, the measures cities must employ when left to
tackle dirty air on their own are politically contentious, and therefore
vulnerable. That s because they inevitably put the costs of cleaning the air on to individual drivers 一 who must pay fees or buy better vehicles 一 rather than on to the car manufacturers whose cheating is the real cause of our toxic pollution.

It’s not hard to imagine a similar reversal happening in London. The new
ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) is likely to be a big issue in next year’s mayoral election. And if Sadiq Khan wins and extends it to the North and South Circular roads in 2021 as he intends, it is sure to spark intense opposition from the far larger number of motorists who will then be affected.

It’s not that measures such as London’s Ulez are useless. Far from it. Local
officials are using the levers that are available to them to safeguard residents’
health in the face of a serious threat. The zones do deliver some improvements to air quality, and the science tells us that means real health benefits - fewer
heart attacks, strokes and premature births, less cancer, dementia and asthma.

Fewer untimely deaths.

But mayors and councilors can only do so much about a problem that is far
bigger than any one city or town. They are acting because national governments 一 Britain s and others across Europe - have failed to do so.

Restrictions that keep highly polluting cars out of certain areas - city
centers, 。school streets”, even individual roads - are a response to the absence of a larger effort to properly enforce existing regulations and require auto
companies to bring their vehicles into compliance. Wales has introduced special low speed limits to minimize pollution. We re doing everything but insist that manufacturers clean up their cars.

Which of the following is true about Madrid’s clean air zone?

[A] Its effects are questionable
[B]It has been opposed by a judge
[C] It needs tougher enforcement
[D] Its fate is yet to be decided

Which is considered a weakness of the city-level measures to tackle dirty
air?

[A] They are biased against car manufacturers.

[B] They prove impractical for city councils.

[C] They are deemed too mild for politicians.

D] They put too much burden on individual motorists.

The author believes that the extension of London’s Ulez will .

[A] arouse strong resistance.

[B] ensure Khan’s electoral success.

[C] improve the city s traffic.

[D] discourage car manufacturing.

Who does the author think should have addressed the problem?

[A] Local residents
[B]Mayors.

[C] Councilors.

[D] National governments.

It can be inferred from the last paragraph that auto companies.

[A] will raise low-emission car production
[B]should be forced to follow regulations
[C] will upgrade the design of their vehicles
[D] should be put under public supervision

Now that members of Generation Z are graduating college this springthe
most commonly-accepted definition says this generation was bom after 1995,
give or take a year-the attention has been rising steadily in recent weeks. GenZs are about to hit the streets looking for work in a labor market that’s tighter than it’s been in decades. And employers are planning on hiring about 17 percent
more new graduates for jobs in the U.S. this year than last, according to a
survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.

Everybody wants to know how the people who will soon inhabit those empty
office cubicles will differ from those who came before them.

If”entitled”is the most common adjective, fairly or not, applied to
millennials (those bom between 1981 and 1995), the catchwords for Generation
Z are practical and cautious. According to the career counselors and expert who study them, Generation Zs are clear-eyed, economic pragmatists. Despite
graduating into the best economy in the past 50 years, Gen Zs know what an
economic train wreck looks like. They were impressionable kids during the
crash of 2008, when many of their parents lost their jobs or their life savings or both. They aren’t interested in taking any chances. The booming economy
seems to have done little to assuage this underlying generational sense of
anxious urgency, especially for those who have college debt. College loan
balances in the U.S. now stand at a record $1.5 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.

One survey from Accenture found that 88 percent of graduating seniors
this year chose their major with a job in mind. In a 2019 survey of University of Georgia students, meanwhile, the career office found the most desirable trait in a future employer was the ability to offer secure employment (followed by
professional development and training, and then inspiring purpose). Job
security or stability was the second most important career goal (work-life
balance was number one), followed by a sense of being dedicated to a cause or
to feel good about serving the great good.

Generation Zs graduating college this spring_.

[A] are recognized for their abilities
[B] are in favor of job offers
[C] are optimistic about the labor market
[D] are drawing growing public attention

Generation Zs are keenly aware_.

[A] what a tough economic situation is like
[B] what their parents expect of them
[C] how they differ from past generations
[D] I how valuable a counselors advice is

The word”assuage”(line 9, para 2)is closet in meaning to_.

[A]define [B]relieve [C] maintain [D] deepen
39.It can be learned from Paragraph 3 that Generation Zs_.

[A] care little about their job performance
[B] give top priority to professional training
[C]think it hard to achieve work-Life balance
[D] have a clear idea about their future job
40 Michelsen thinks that compared with millennials, Generation Zs are_.

[A]less realistic B] less adventurous [C]more diligent [D] more generous

Five Ways to Win Over Everyone in the Office
Is it possible to like everyone in your office? Think about how tough it is
to get together 15 people, much less 50, who all get along perfectly. But unlike in friendships, you need coworkers. You work with them every day and you
depend on them just as they depend on you. Here are some ways that you can
get the whole office on your side
41.__
If you have a bone to pick with someone in your workplace, you may try
stay tight-lipped around them. But you won’t be helping either one of you. A
Harvard Business School study found that observers consistently rated those
who were frank about themselves more highly, while those who hid lost
trustworthiness. The lesson is not that you should make your personal life an
open book, but rather, when given the option to offer up details about yourself or painstakingly conceal them, you should just be honest.

42._
Just as important as being honest about yourself is being receptive to
others. We often feel the need to tell others how we feel, whether it’s a concern about a project, a stray thought, or a compliment. Those are all valid, but you need to take time to hear out your coworkers, too. In fact, rushing to get your own ideas out there can cause colleagues to feel you don’t value their opinions.

Do your best to engage coworkers in a genuine, back- and-forth conversation,
rather than prioritizing your own thoughts.

43._
It’s common to have a“cubicle mate” or special confidant in a work setting.

But in addition to those trusted coworkers, you should expand your horizons
and find out about all the people around you. Use your lunch and coffee breaks to meet up with colleagues you don’t always see. Find out about their lives and interests beyond the job. It requires minimal effort and goes a long way. This will help to gTow your internal network, in addition to being a nice break in the work day.

44._
Positive feedback is important for anyone to hear. And you don’t have to
be someone’s boss to tell them they did an exceptional job on a particular
project. This will help engender good will in others. But don’t overdo it or be fake about it. One study found that people responded best to comments that
shifted from negative to positive, possibly because it suggested they had won
somebody over.

45.__
This one may be a bit more difficult to pull off, but it can go a long way to
achieving results. Remember in dealing with any coworker what they appreciate
from an interaction. Watch out for how they verbalize with others. Some people like small talk in a meeting before digging into important matters, while other are more straightforward. Jokes that work one person won’t necessarily land
with another, So, adapt your style accordingly to type. Consider the person that you re dealing with in advance and what will get you to your desired outcome.

It’s almost impossible to go through life without experiencing some kind of failure. People who do so probably live so cautiously that they go nowhere. Put simply, they’re not real living at all. But, the wonderful thing about failure is that it’s entirely up to us to decide how to look at it.

We can choose to see failure as”the end of the world, “or as proof of just how inadequate we are. Or, we can look at failure as the incredible learning
experience that it often is. Every time we fail at something, we can choose to look for the lesson we’re meant to learn. These lessons are very important;
they’re how we grow, and how we keep from making that same mistake again.

Failures stop us only if we let them. Failure can also teach us things about
ourselves that we would never have learned otherwise.

For instance, failure can help you discover how strong a person you are.

Failing at something can help you discover your truest friends, or help you find unexpected motivation to succeed.
